            <h2>The ISKON TEMPLE, Calgary, Canada</h2>
            <img src="location images/Loc1.jpeg" alt="Iskcon Temple">
        <p>The ISKCON Temple in Calgary is one of the beautiful and calm places I have ever been to. The soulful Kirtan is the heart of the place. Initially when I just came to Calgary, I used to be quite upset and overwhelmed with everything around, so after finishing my classes, I would often visit the temple, sit in the kirtan in the calming ambience, it felt like a home away from home.It is a temple devoted to the Hindu Gods- Shri Radha and Krishna. There are many Iskcon temples, like in Vrindavan, Mumbai, United States, Australia, United Kingdom, etc. One should consider wearing decent clothes covering your knees. You will be required to remove your shoes before entering the main hall. The mantra which everyone chants most of the times - "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna  Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare." The most beautiful thing that I find here is the dressup"Shringar" of the deities, once I go there and start looking at them, I can't take my eyes off. The important thing to note before planning your visit, do check with the timings, as most of the times, it is closed from non to early evenings.</p>

        <h2>Radha Rani Temple, Barsana, Uttar Pradesh, India</h2>
        <img src="location images/Loc2.jpeg" alt="Shri Radha Rani Temple Barsana">
        <p> This place literally feels like heaven on earth for me. Also known as Shri Ladli Lal Mandir, this one is a Hindu Temple devoted to Shri Radha Rani at the top of a hill. You will always find this place full of devotees. The last time I visited here ws before coming to Canada in August with my family. It is associated with the birth place of Shri Radha Rani. If you ever want to visit here, there are two ways you can go, one is by any of your vehicles, and I would warn you as the way through vehicles is so narrow and so inclined, and I don't feel much comfortable that way, so I usually take the walking path, which takes to the main enterance door. There are people at the starting of the journey where bike riders are present and one can pay them and they help to reach the temple. The Holi festival of this place is famous everywhere. The celebrations for this festival starts around a month before and have different types of Holi celebrated everyday. This is the time when this place is the most crowded. There are many garlands shops on the way to the temple, some people bring handmade garlands and some people just take it from thses vendors.</p>

        <h2>Crescent Hill, Calgary, Canada</h2>
        <img src="location images/Loc3.jpeg" alt="The beautiful view at the Crescent Hill">
        <p> This was the first place I ever visited in Calgary with the girl I share my place with. Having no relatives or family here, she was nice enough to offer me to explore a little bit of Calgary. This place is one of the best scenes you can ever come accross in Calgary, especially at night time. If you ever feel exhausted by the daily routine and hectic life, you can just grab some snacks and coffee and walk there or sit down for sometime , you will feel so relaxed like never before. But the most important thing is to note the parking, you should be careful and find a parking spot nearby, as it is a residential area, so sometimes people just park their cars randomly at any place. All of us cannot afford to buy a house at such an iconic place but experiencing this is a must have. Even during the daytime, the view is never going to disappoint you. Thsi is one of the best spots to get your photographs clicked, especially during the sunset, you will never need to edit those pictures to look good with the aesthetics. The view of the tall buildings of downtown is simply spectacular.</p>
