        <p>The ISKCON Temple in Calgary is one of the beautiful and calm places I have ever been to. The soulful Kirtan is the heart of the place. Initially when I just came to Calgary, I used to be quite upset and overwhelmed with everything around, so after finishing my classes, I would often visit the temple, sit in the kirtan in the calming ambience, it felt like a home away from home.It is a temple devoted to the Hindu Gods- Shri Radha and Krishna. There are many Iskcon temples, like in Vrindavan, Mumbai, United States, Australia, United Kingdom, etc. One should consider wearing decent clothes covering your knees. You will be required to remove your shoes before entering the main hall. The mantra which everyone chants most of the times - "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna  Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare." The most beautiful thing that I find here is the dressup"Shringar" of the deities, once I go there and start looking at them, I can't take my eyes off. The important thing to note before planning your visit, do check with the timings, as most of the times, it is closed from non to early evenings.</p>
