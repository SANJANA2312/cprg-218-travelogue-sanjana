        <p>The ISKCON Temple in Calgary is one of the beautiful and calm places I have ever been to. The soulful Kirtan is the heart of the place. Initially when I just came to Calgary, I used to be quite upset and overwhelmed with everything around, so after finishing my classes, I would often visit the temple, sit in the kirtan in the calming ambience.</p>     </section>
